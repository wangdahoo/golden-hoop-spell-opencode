## Example 2: Sprint Planning Session (progress.md)

```markdown
## Sprint Planning - 2024-01-15
**Agent**: Sprint Agent
**Sprint**: s1 - Authentication Sprint

### Requirements Received
- User authentication with email/password
- Social login with Google and GitHub
- Password reset functionality
- Email verification required
- Secure token storage
- Rate limiting for security

### Features Planned
- Total: 6 features
- High priority: 5 (core authentication flow)
- Medium priority: 1 (registration enhancement)
- Low priority: 0

### Sprint Goal
Implement complete user authentication flow including social login, email verification, and secure token management. Users should be able to register, login, and logout securely.

### Implementation Order
1. s1-feat-001 - Setup auth provider (infra) - COMPLETED
2. s1-feat-005 - Create user database schema (data) - COMPLETED
3. s1-feat-002 - Create login page (ui) - IN PROGRESS
4. s1-feat-003 - Implement login API endpoint (api) - PENDING
5. s1-feat-004 - Connect login form to API (core) - PENDING
6. s1-feat-006 - Create registration page (ui) - PENDING

### Technical Decisions
- Chose Auth0 over custom JWT for faster initial implementation
- Using PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for user data
- Storing JWT in HTTP-only cookies for XSS protection
- Rate limiting at 5 attempts per minute for login

### Notes
- Password reset functionality deferred to Sprint 2
- Social login buttons in UI but implementation in Sprint 3
- Need to coordinate with design team on login page mockups
```

## Example 3: Coding Session (progress.md)

```markdown
## Session 2 - 2024-01-16
**Agent**: Coding Agent
**Sprint**: s1
**Feature**: s1-feat-002 - Create login page

### Implementation
- Created LoginForm component with email and password fields
- Implemented form validation using React Hook Form
- Added show/hide password toggle button
- Created SocialLoginButtons component with Google and GitHub buttons
- Added loading spinner state during form submission
- Styled components using CSS modules

### Files Changed
- src/components/LoginForm.tsx - Main login form component
- src/components/SocialLoginButtons.tsx - Social login button component
- src/styles/Login.module.css - Login page styles
- src/types/auth.ts - TypeScript types for auth forms

### Tests Performed
- Tested form validation with invalid email format ✓
- Tested required field validation ✓
- Tested password visibility toggle ✓
- Tested responsive layout on mobile (375px) and tablet (768px) ✓
- Tested keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter) ✓
- Tested with screen reader (VoiceOver) ✓
- No console errors ✓
- Lint passes ✓

### Issues Encountered
- Initially used email pattern validation that was too strict, relaxed to accept + signs in emails
- Had to adjust button spacing for mobile view, added media query

### Acceptance Criteria Status
- [x] Login form displays correctly on desktop and mobile
- [x] Email validation shows error for invalid format
- [x] Password field shows/hides password toggle
- [x] Error messages display for failed login attempts (component ready)
- [x] Social login buttons (Google, GitHub) are present
- [x] Loading state shown during authentication (component ready)

### Next Steps
- Ready for s1-feat-003: Implement login API endpoint
- After API is ready, s1-feat-004 will connect form to API
```

## Example 4: Archive Directory Structure

After archiving completed sprint:

```
project-root/
├── .ghs/
│   ├── features.json          (s1 removed, only s2 remains)
│   ├── progress.md            (updated with archive entry)
│   └── archived/
│       └── s1_authentication_sprint_20240120_143000/
│           ├── features.json    (complete s1 data)
│           └── progress.md      (all s1 sessions)
```

## Usage Patterns

### Sprint Agent Workflow

1. Read this file and [sprint-agent.md](sprint-agent.md)
2. Archive completed sprints (if any)
3. Analyze user requirements
4. Create features following the authentication sprint example
5. Update `.ghs/features.json` and `.ghs/progress.md`

### Coding Agent Workflow

1. Read this file and [coding-agent.md](coding-agent.md)
2. Select ONE feature from current sprint
3. Implement following the coding session example
4. Test thoroughly using checklist
5. Update `.ghs/progress.md` and `.ghs/features.json`
