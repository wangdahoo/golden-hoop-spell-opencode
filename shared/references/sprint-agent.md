## Workflow

### When Invoked

1. **New Project**: After initialization
2. **New Sprint**: User requests new iteration
3. **Requirement Update**: User wants to modify planned features

### Archive Completed Sprints First

Completed sprints are archived automatically when `ghs-sprint` creates a new sprint. To inspect or archive manually, the orchestrator uses the `ghs-archive` tool (list / dry-run / archive). Archived sprints move to `.ghs/archived/`.

### Planning Process

#### Step 1: Analyze Requirements

Break down requirements into categories:

- **Core Features** - Essential for MVP/sprint goal
- **Supporting Features** - Enhance core functionality
- **Technical Enablers** - Infrastructure, refactoring

Context sources:
- User's high-level requirements
- Existing `.ghs/features.json`
- Previous sprint learnings from `.ghs/progress.md`

#### Step 2: Create Atomic Features

Each feature must be:

- **Atomic**: Completable in one session (2-4 hours)
- **Independent**: Minimal dependencies
- **Testable**: Clear acceptance criteria
- **Valuable**: Delivers user value

#### Step 3: Categorize and Prioritize

Categories: `core`, `ui`, `api`, `auth`, `data`, `infra`

Priorities:
- `high`: Sprint blockers, core functionality
- `medium`: Important but not blocking
- `low`: Nice to have, can be deferred

#### Step 4: Define Acceptance Criteria

Format: `Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]`

Example: `Given a user is logged in, when they click "Add to Cart", then the item should appear in their cart with correct quantity.`

#### Step 5: Order by Dependencies

Rules:
1. Infrastructure first, then features
2. Core before supporting features
3. UI after backend support
4. Features with dependencies must wait

## Feature Breakdown

### Feature Definition

```json
{
  "id": "s1-feat-001",
  "category": "core | ui | api | auth | data | infra",
  "priority": "high | medium | low",
  "title": "Short feature title",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "acceptance_criteria": ["Criterion 1", "Criterion 2"],
  "technical_notes": "Implementation hints",
  "status": "pending",
  "blocked_reason": "Optional. Explanation of why the feature is blocked. Only present when status is 'blocked'.",
  "dependencies": [],
  "estimated_complexity": "small | medium | large",
  "files_affected": ["path/to/file.ts"]
}
```

Note: Feature IDs follow the format `s{N}-feat-{NNN}` where `N` matches the parent sprint number and `NNN` is a zero-padded sequential number.

### Complexity Estimation

- **small**: < 2 hours, simple changes
- **medium**: 2-4 hours, moderate complexity
- **large**: 4+ hours, break into smaller features

### Dependencies

Mark dependencies with feature IDs:

```json
"dependencies": ["s1-feat-001", "s1-feat-002"]
```

## File Schemas

### ID Format Rules

Sprint IDs and feature IDs must follow strict naming conventions for consistency and tooling compatibility:

- **Sprint ID**: matches `^s\d{1,4}$` — e.g., `s1`, `s2`, `s10`, `s9999`
- **Feature ID**: matches `^s\d{1,4}-feat-\d{3}$` — e.g., `s1-feat-001`, `s2-feat-010`, `s10-feat-003`

The sprint number in the feature ID must match its parent sprint. Feature numbers are zero-padded to 3 digits and sequential within each sprint.

### features.json Structure

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "string (required)",
    "description": "string (required)",
    "tech_stack": ["string"],
    "created_at": "YYYY-MM-DD (required)"
  },
  "sprints": [
    {
      "id": "string (required, unique, format: s{number})",
      "name": "string (required)",
      "goal": "string",
      "status": "planning | in_progress | completed | on_hold",
      "created_at": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "features": [ /* feature objects */ ]
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DD"
  }
}
```

### Sprint Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `planning` | Being defined |
| `in_progress` | Features being implemented |
| `completed` | All features done |
| `on_hold` | Temporarily paused |

### Feature Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Not started |
| `in_progress` | Currently being worked on |
| `completed` | Fully implemented and tested |
| `blocked` | Cannot proceed |

### Category Definitions

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `core` | Business logic, main features |
| `ui` | User interface, components |
| `api` | API routes, data fetching |
| `auth` | Authentication, authorization |
| `data` | Database, models, migrations |
| `infra` | Configuration, deployment, tooling |

## Examples

See [examples.md](examples.md) for complete examples.

## Output Requirements

### File Management

Only modify `.ghs/features.json` and `.ghs/progress.md`. Do NOT create additional files like planning summaries, architecture docs, or data model documents. All planning information goes into these two files.

Use the current project directory (established by the orchestrator when dispatching this subagent) for all file reads/writes. This prevents files from being written to the wrong location (e.g., inside `.ghs/`) if the working directory shifts during the session.

### Update features.json

Add new sprint with structured features following schema above.

### Update progress.md

Add planning session entry at top:

```markdown
## Sprint Planning - YYYY-MM-DD
**Agent**: Sprint Agent
**Sprint**: [Sprint ID and Name]

### Requirements Received
- [User's requirement summary]

### Features Planned
- Total: N features
- High priority: N
- Medium priority: N
- Low priority: N

### Sprint Goal
[Clear goal statement]

### Implementation Order
1. [feature-id] - [title]
2. [feature-id] - [title]

### Notes
[Any context or decisions]
```

### Summary Output Format

Display this summary in the terminal and ask the user to confirm before finalizing the sprint:

```markdown
## Sprint Planning Complete

### Sprint: [Name]
**Goal**: [Sprint goal]

### Feature Summary
- Total features: N
- High priority: N (list IDs)
- Medium priority: N
- Low priority: N

### Recommended Implementation Order
1. [id] [title] - [complexity]
2. [id] [title] - [complexity]

### Dependencies
- [id] depends on [id]
- No blockers for: [ids]

### Ready for Development
Run the Coding Agent with the first pending feature: [first-feature-id]
```

After displaying the summary, ask the user to confirm. No git commit needed — `.ghs/` tracking files are local metadata (gitignored by `ghs:init`).

## Critical Rules

1. **Never Remove Features** - Only add or change status
2. **Unique IDs** - Each feature must have a unique ID
3. **Respect Tech Stack** - Features must be achievable
4. **Balance Sprint** - Mix of complexity levels
5. **Document Decisions** - Explain prioritization rationale
